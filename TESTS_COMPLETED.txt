PAY-3162 UNIT TESTS - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
================================================================================

COMPONENT: WorkflowExecutionsCard.vue
ISSUE: Race condition causing "sin" text concatenation when execution stops
FIX: Added condition && !execution.stoppedAt to prevent rendering

TEST FILE: WorkflowExecutionsCard.test.ts
TEST FRAMEWORK: vitest
LOCATION: /Users/csaba/Downloads/n8n-worktrees/pay-3162/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/features/execution/executions/components/workflow/

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

TOTAL TESTS: 11 passing
- 7 existing tests (still passing)
- 4 new tests for PAY-3162 fix

✓ with execution retry button visibility tests (5 parametrized tests)
✓ displays correct text for new execution
✓ uses `createdAt` to calculate running time if `startedAt` is undefined

NEW TESTS (PAY-3162):
✓ displays "for" time when execution is running without stoppedAt
✓ hides "for" time when execution has stoppedAt (even if status is running) [CRITICAL]
✓ hides "for" time when execution status is not running
✓ shows running time for execution without startedAt but with running status

STATUS: ALL TESTS PASSING
DURATION: 8.58 seconds
TYPE CHECK: PASSING
LINT: PASSING

================================================================================
TEST COVERAGE
================================================================================

1. HAPPY PATH (Normal Running Execution)
   - Scenario: execution with status='running', no stoppedAt
   - Test: displays "for" time when execution is running without stoppedAt
   - Result: PASS - Element rendered and contains "for" text

2. RACE CONDITION (Core Bug Fix)
   - Scenario: execution with status='running' BUT has stoppedAt
   - Test: hides "for" time when execution has stoppedAt (even if status is running)
   - Result: PASS - Element NOT rendered (bug fixed)

3. COMPLETED EXECUTION (Edge Case)
   - Scenario: execution with status='success', has stoppedAt
   - Test: hides "for" time when execution status is not running
   - Result: PASS - Element NOT rendered

4. FALLBACK SCENARIO (Edge Case)
   - Scenario: execution with status='running', no startedAt (uses createdAt)
   - Test: shows running time for execution without startedAt but with running status
   - Result: PASS - Element rendered and contains "for" text

================================================================================
KEY TESTING PATTERNS
================================================================================

✓ Fake Timers: vitest.useFakeTimers() for deterministic time calculations
✓ Component Props: Realistic ExecutionSummary objects with proper timestamps
✓ DOM Assertions: queryByTestId() verification with .toBeVisible()/.toBeNull()
✓ Race Condition Modeling: Explicit test for status/stoppedAt mismatch
✓ Type Safety: Proper TypeScript types for all test data
✓ Mocking: Vue Router and Pinia stores properly mocked

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN TESTS

   - Lines 203-302: Added new describe block "Running execution time display (PAY-3162)"
   - Added 4 new test cases
   - No changes to existing tests

================================================================================
QUALITY ASSURANCE
================================================================================

✓ TypeScript Typecheck: PASSING
✓ ESLint Linting: PASSING
✓ All Tests: PASSING (11/11)
✓ Component Rendering: VERIFIED

✓ Backward Compatibility: VERIFIED (7 existing tests still pass)

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

The PAY-3162 fix has been thoroughly tested with a comprehensive test suite that:

1. Verifies the fix prevents the concatenation bug in race conditions
2. Ensures normal running execution behavior is preserved
3. Tests all edge cases and fallback scenarios
4. Uses realistic ExecutionSummary objects with proper type safety
5. Employs controlled timers for deterministic test results
6. Maintains backward compatibility with existing tests

The critical test case explicitly models the race condition where status is 'running'
but stoppedAt has a value, verifying that the "for" time indicator is NOT rendered
(which was the bug). The fix is production-ready.
