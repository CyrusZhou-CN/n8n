# PAY-3162 Unit Test Summary

## Issue Overview
Race condition in WorkflowExecutionsCard component where the "for" time display (running duration indicator) was showing concatenated text when an execution had been stopped but the status field hadn't been updated yet.

## The Fix
**File:** `/Users/csaba/Downloads/n8n-worktrees/pay-3162/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/features/execution/executions/components/workflow/WorkflowExecutionsCard.vue`

**Line 116 - Added condition:** `&& !execution.stoppedAt`

```vue
<N8nText
  v-if="executionUIDetails.name === 'running' && !execution.stoppedAt"
  :color="isActive ? 'text-dark' : 'text-base'"
  size="small"
  data-test-id="execution-time-in-status"
>
  {{ locale.baseText('executionDetails.runningTimeRunning') }}
  <ExecutionsTime :start-time="execution.startedAt ?? execution.createdAt" />
</N8nText>
```

The condition now checks both:
1. Status field equals 'running'
2. AND the execution has NO `stoppedAt` timestamp (not stopped yet)

This prevents showing the running time indicator when an execution has physically stopped but the status hasn't been updated.

## Test Suite Implementation
**File:** `/Users/csaba/Downloads/n8n-worktrees/pay-3162/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/features/execution/executions/components/workflow/WorkflowExecutionsCard.test.ts`

### Test Cases Added (4 new tests in describe block)

#### Test 1: Running Execution Without stoppedAt (Happy Path)
```typescript
test('displays "for" time when execution is running without stoppedAt', () => {
```
- **Scenario:** Normal running execution
- **Setup:** status='running', startedAt defined, stoppedAt undefined
- **Expected:** "for" time indicator is visible and shows running duration
- **Validates:** Core functionality works correctly when execution is truly running

#### Test 2: Race Condition - Running Status with stoppedAt (Critical Test)
```typescript
test('hides "for" time when execution has stoppedAt (even if status is running)', () => {
```
- **Scenario:** Execution has been stopped but status field still shows 'running'
- **Setup:** status='running', stoppedAt defined (race condition)
- **Expected:** "for" time indicator is NOT visible
- **Validates:** The fix prevents the concatenation bug when race condition occurs

#### Test 3: Completed Execution (Edge Case)
```typescript
test('hides "for" time when execution status is not running', () => {
```
- **Scenario:** Completed execution (success status)
- **Setup:** status='success', stoppedAt defined
- **Expected:** "for" time indicator is NOT visible
- **Validates:** Non-running executions never show running time

#### Test 4: Fallback Behavior (Edge Case)
```typescript
test('shows running time for execution without startedAt but with running status', () => {
```
- **Scenario:** Running execution without startedAt (uses createdAt fallback)
- **Setup:** status='running', startedAt undefined, stoppedAt undefined
- **Expected:** "for" time indicator is visible (uses createdAt as fallback)
- **Validates:** Correct behavior when startedAt is missing but execution is running

## Test Results
```
âœ“ src/features/execution/executions/components/workflow/WorkflowExecutionsCard.test.ts (11 tests) 285ms

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  11 passed (11)
  Start at  17:03:45
  Duration  8.66s
```

### Test Breakdown
- **1 existing test** (creates component without errors)
- **5 parametrized tests** (retry button visibility tests)
- **1 existing test** (new execution display)
- **1 existing test** (createdAt fallback for running time)
- **4 new tests** (PAY-3162 specific scenarios)
- **Total: 11 tests passing**

## Coverage Analysis

### Scenarios Covered by New Tests

| Scenario | Test | Status | Coverage |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| Normal running execution | Test 1 | PASS | Happy path verification |
| Race condition (bug scenario) | Test 2 | PASS | Critical fix validation |
| Non-running execution | Test 3 | PASS | Edge case prevention |
| Missing startedAt fallback | Test 4 | PASS | Fallback logic verification |

### Code Quality Checks
- **TypeScript:** Passes (no type errors)
- **Linting:** Passes (proper code style)
- **Test Framework:** vitest (frontend testing)
- **Mocking:** Vue Router, Pinia stores properly mocked
- **Timer Management:** Uses `vitest.useFakeTimers()` for reliable time-based tests

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Fake Timers
Used `vitest.useFakeTimers()` to control time in tests, essential for verifying running time calculations

### 2. Component Props Testing
Created realistic ExecutionSummary objects with all necessary fields to test component behavior

### 3. DOM Assertions
Used `queryByTestId()` to verify the specific element with `data-test-id="execution-time-in-status"` is rendered or hidden

### 4. Null Checks
Used `.toBeNull()` to verify elements are NOT rendered in certain scenarios (negative testing)

## How to Run Tests

```bash
cd /Users/csaba/Downloads/n8n-worktrees/pay-3162/packages/frontend/editor-ui
pnpm test WorkflowExecutionsCard
```

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/csaba/Downloads/n8n-worktrees/pay-3162/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/features/execution/executions/components/workflow/WorkflowExecutionsCard.test.ts`
   - Added 4 new test cases in a "Running execution time display (PAY-3162)" describe block
   - 68 lines added
   - No changes to existing tests

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Test file exists and is properly configured
- [x] All 4 new tests pass
- [x] All 11 total tests pass
- [x] TypeScript typecheck passes
- [x] Code style is correct
- [x] Race condition scenario is covered
- [x] Edge cases are covered
- [x] Component fix is verified by tests

## Conclusion
The unit test suite comprehensively covers the PAY-3162 fix by:
1. Verifying the fix prevents the concatenation bug in race conditions
2. Ensuring normal running execution behavior is preserved
3. Testing edge cases and fallback scenarios
4. Using realistic ExecutionSummary objects with proper type safety
5. Employing controlled timers for deterministic test results

The tests validate that the condition `&& !execution.stoppedAt` effectively prevents the "for" time indicator from rendering when an execution has been stopped, eliminating the concatenation issue while maintaining all existing functionality.
